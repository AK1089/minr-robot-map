    @player &7[&cForeman&7] &7Heya there! Thanks for dropping on by - I'm excited to see what Claude can do for us here at the quarry.
    @delay 60
    @player &7[&cForeman&7] &7D'ya think Claude could get the coal from down there into that there chest minecart?
    @delay 60
    @player &7[&cForeman&7] &7The mine's not too far down, but it's a 5-second drop in a tight spot. I would rather the little guy does it than one of my men is all.
    @delay 80
    @player &7[&cForeman&7] &7Should be a straightforward job: get him to go down the chute, climb up those stairs, get the coal, and throw it into the lil' hopper down there.
    @delay 80
    @player &7[&cForeman&7] &7Ya think you could get that done? Just come back and say hello when you're done.
    @delay 60
    @player &7[&cInfo&7] &eWrite a program for Claude to descend the mineshaft, navigate to the pressure plate to obtain some coal, and deposit the coal in the hopper.

    @player &7[&cForeman&7] &7Why, that's a mighty fine job you've done there! My men'll be so happy that they don't gotta go down there no more.

    @player &7[&cForeman&7] &7Say, this little guy's pretty smart, right? We try to send down torches to the caves a dozen at a time. Reckon he could do that for me?
    @delay 60
    @player &7[&cForeman&7] &7Over on the west side, there's a torch dispenser. It's hidden just behind a wall - you might have to break some stone to get to it. 
    @delay 80
    @player &7[&cForeman&7] &7Can ya fetch a dozen torches and load 'em up into the cart, then send it down to the caves when they're all in there?
    @delay 80
    @player &7[&cInfo&7] &eWrite a program for Claude to get to the torch dispenser, load 12 torches into the hopper minecart, then press the button to send it down to the caves.
